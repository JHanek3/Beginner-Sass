1. Sass is ...?

A scripting Language that is used to extend CSS
A CSS pre processor
Widely adopted by the programming industry

2. This style rule is an example of what?

SASS
I don't like that answer, SASS does not have ; nor brackets
Maybe its just trying to show that variables are use

3.
Variables in Sass can store what kind of values?

Any valid CSS values in all CSS versions

4.
Will this Sass compile successfully?
#radness-box
  color: $primary-color;
  background: purple;
  font-size: $base-font;

No way! The semi-colons break it
