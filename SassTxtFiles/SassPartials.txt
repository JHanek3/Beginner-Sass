Partials help modularize your project
  break it down into smaller snippets of Sass
Sass and CSS folders
  dump files in corresponding folders
actual sass partial has a leading underscore

_footer.sass tells sass not to compile the file

We were watching a file and telling it to output a specific file
  we are no longer watching just a file, but a whole directory
to watch a folder
sass --watch SASS:CSS
  watch the SASS folder and output it into the CSS file
  creates a bunch of CSS files from the SASS files
have to _ lead to the directory files as well

Partials just keep everything cleaner, don't forget your import statements
